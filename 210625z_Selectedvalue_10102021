You need a way of seeing which location is in the current filter context
(or in plain english, which row of the table you're currently calculating), then selecting the appropriate parameter value based on that.

This measure uses SELECTEDVALUE to see which location we're calculating and a SWITCH statement to 
select which parameter value to add.  You can keep adding lines into the switch statement for each location.


Output =
VAR _Base = MAX(MainTable[SUM C1-C3])
VAR _Param =
SWITCH(
    SELECTEDVALUE(MainTable[Area]),
      "CA", [Parameter Value],
      "CPAC", [CPAC Value]
)
RETURN
_Base + _Param
