** You should use ISINSCOPE not HASONEVALUE which will fix the issue since you don't want to show any values if there is any grouping.

Max = IF ( ISINSCOPE ( 'Table'[Full Name] ), MAX ( 'Table'[Age Band] ) )

Selectedvalue =
IF (
    ISINSCOPE ( 'Table'[Full Name] ),
    TOPN ( 1, VALUES ( 'Table'[Age Band] ) )
)


I guess either case (Max or TOPN ( 1, VALUES)), both are logically same? When do we use Max and when do we use TOPN?

---> I didn't use MAX since the age band is text, not numerical value, so I selected the first available text value.
