I am trying to understand this DAX code here.

DAYSINMONTH =
               day(calculate(
                                       ENDOFMONTH('Calendar'[Date]),
                                       Table1
                                    )
                       )
 
Why do we have Table1 here?



Indeed, this is how filters works in DAX. It's an explicit leveraging of Expanded Table in such statements, CALCULATE( XXX, Table ).
