Your code was great, but I had to add "SelectedValue" or 
it appears that I had to aggregate to get rid of error. 
How do I fix to select only one value?  Because error was gone, but I don't think my logic goes thru though. Thanks.


@JustinDoh1 That's just because you must have written a measure and the formula I wrote was for a column, 
hence why I called it column. 
SELECTEDVALUE will work although I tend to use MAX or MIN. 
But, remember, this is going to depend heavily on context for the measure to work properly.
