Reasons to use SUMX: 
SUMX accepts a table expression as the first parameter so you can filter it however you please and then 
SUMX takes the second parameter, evaluates the expression for each row of the table and then sums the results together.
You can see the difference between SUMX and CALCULATE. Take a simple table like below:
ItemQuantityValue

One	5	5
Two	10	10
Three	20	20

And the following measures:
Sumx1 = SUMX(FILTER('Items',[Item]<>"Two"),[Quantity]*[Value])
Caculate1 = CALCULATE(SUM('Items'[Quantity])*SUM('Items'[Value]),'Items'[Item]<>"Two")

SUMX returns the correct answer 425 while CALCULATE returns the wrong answer 625. 
SUMX got the right answer because it evaluated at the row level, 5*5 + 20*20. 
CALCULATE got it wrong because it calculated (20 + 5) * (20 + 5).
