The first part:

VAR Refused =
DISTINCT (
    SUMMARIZE (
        FILTER ( 'Table', 'Table'[Consent] = "Refused" ),
        'Table'[ClientID]
    )
)

defines the variable 'Refused' as the single-column table comprising the distinct values from the 
ClientID column for which the Consent column entry is "Refused".
The next variable is similarly defined, though for Consent column entries of "Consented".
The EXCEPT clause then returns a single-column table comprising all Client ID entries from the 'Refused' table which do not appear in the 'Consent' table.
Finally, the number of rows in this last table are counted.
